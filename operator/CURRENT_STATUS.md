# CURRENT STATUS — OPERATOR

**Current milestone:** 3 — Meta device access (implemented; awaiting device verification of Milestones 1–3)

**Last updated:** 2026-09-05

## What works (verified)

- `:core` compiles and its 39 unit tests pass locally and in CI.
- `:app` compiles (`assembleDebug`) and its unit tests pass in GitHub Actions; debug APK attached
  to each green run as `operator-debug-apk`. See the CI note below for `:glasses-meta`.

## What is implemented but NOT yet verified on a device

- Milestones 1–2: audio loopback, route selection, Bluetooth diagnostics (see earlier checklist
  items below).
- Milestone 3: `:glasses-meta` wraps the Meta Wearables Device Access Toolkit 0.9.0 behind
  `GlassesProvider`: SDK initialisation, registration with the Meta AI app, linked-device list
  with metadata, device session start/stop, camera-permission check, firmware-update link, and
  MockDeviceKit developer actions. Glasses panel + GLASSES subsystem indicator. Capability
  findings are in `docs/META_GLASSES.md`.

## Key finding

The Meta toolkit exposes **no microphone or speaker API** (0.9.0). Glasses audio stays on the
standard Bluetooth path built in Milestone 2. The SDK contributes camera, device state,
registration, and mock testing.

## Build notes

- The SDK lives on GitHub Packages and needs a token with `read:packages`. With
  `github_token` in `local.properties` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the environment) the
  `:glasses-meta` module is included; without it the app still builds and the Glasses panel
  says "not compiled in". CI passes `GITHUB_TOKEN` and forces `-Poperator.metaSdk=true`.
- minSdk is now 31 (Android 12), matching Meta's samples and the communication-device API.

## What does not work / not started

- Camera streaming/photo (Milestone 16), backend, memory, AI, TTS, transcription, rolling
  context, decision engine, BLE ring, integrations.
- No launcher icon.

## Current blockers

- Human verification on hardware. Milestone 3 additionally needs: the Meta AI app with
  Developer Mode enabled, the glasses paired to it, and a GitHub token for the build.

## Next test (required before Milestone 4)

Milestone 1 (phone audio): launch → GRANT MICROPHONE → RECORD TEST → PLAY TEST → speech
understandable → actual devices correct.

Milestone 2 (Bluetooth): GRANT BLUETOOTH → paired list shows headset/glasses → OUTPUT=A2DP
PLAY TEST → INPUT=SCO RECORD TEST with route-log "Communication device active" → OUTPUT=SCO
PLAY TEST → disconnect falls back to DEFAULT → note SCO bring-up time.

Milestone 3 (Meta SDK): follow the device test plan in `docs/META_GLASSES.md` (register,
device list, session start/stop, camera permission, mock kit) and record the glasses' reported
device type string.
